# Linear-Regression-with-Categoric-and-Numeric-Data
In this program, we fit a linear regression model to the "Melbourne Housing Market" dataset, which you can find here: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market/. The dataset is made up of a number of numeric and categorical features.
You will learn how to handle features with a large number of categories and also improve a model's performance by reducing the number of categories available in each feature.
We will start by importing the dataset and analyzing the distribution of different features.
We will plot the features, run tests for correlation and association, and identify the most important features that help estimate the value of a property.
After that, we will fit a predictive model using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression module.
Finally, we will test the model fitted to our data over various seeds and examine the fit statistics to determine the best model.
